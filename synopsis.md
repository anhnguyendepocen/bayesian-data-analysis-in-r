# Bayesian Data Analysis in R

This workshop provides an introduction to Bayesian data analysis in R.
You will learn about R packages that facilitate Bayesian approaches to
data analysis, how to use these tools and how to interpret their outputs.
Some familiarity with R is required. Basic knowledge of Bayesian methods
will be helpful but is not mandatory. If you have no experience with
Bayesian data analysis, the introductory workshop held the week prior
may be a good starting point.
